# Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored 
# at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

# linkedlist

# Why Linked List?
# Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.
# 1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. 
# Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
# 2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the 
# new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

# For example, in a system, if we maintain a sorted list of IDs in an array id[].

# id[] = [1000, 1010, 1050, 2000, 2040].




# And if we want to insert a new ID 1005, then to maintain the sorted order, we have to move all the elements
#  after 1000 (excluding 1000).
# Deletion is also expensive with arrays until unless some special techniques are used. For example, to delete
#  1010 in id[], everything after 1010 has to be moved.

# Advantages over arrays
# 1) Dynamic size
# 2) Ease of insertion/deletion

# Drawbacks:
# 1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node.
#  So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. 
# 2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
# 3) Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of
#  reference which is not there in case of linked lists.
